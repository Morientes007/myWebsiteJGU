                <h3>Explainable AI & Dynamic Programming</h3>
                <p>Developed methods for automatically generating explanations for computation results, particularly in dynamic programming algorithms. This work was conducted under DARPA's Explainable AI (XAI) program.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="research-card">
                <h3>Message Passing Language (MPL)</h3>
                <p>Designed and implemented a type-safe concurrent programming language with a novel type system and abstract machine for execution.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="research-card">
                <h3>Domain-Specific Languages</h3>
                <p>Created DSLs for various domains including game-theoretic matching (MatchMaker), explanatory decision making (MADMAX), and combinatorial optimization.</p>
